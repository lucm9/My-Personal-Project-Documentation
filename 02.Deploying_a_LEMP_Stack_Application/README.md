# Deploying a LEMP Stack Application On AWS Cloud

A LEMP stack is a software stack typically used for web development. LEMP stands for Linux, Nginx (pronounced "engine-x"), MySQL (or MariaDB), and PHP. Each component plays a specific role in hosting dynamic websites and applications. Here's a brief overview of each component in the LEMP stack:

**Linux**: The operating system, which is the foundation of the stack. Common Linux distributions used in LEMP stacks include Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS.

**Nginx**: A web server and reverse proxy server. Nginx is known for its performance, scalability, and ability to handle a large number of simultaneous connections. It's often used to serve static content and as a reverse proxy to forward requests to application servers (e.g., PHP-FPM).

**MySQL (or MariaDB)**: A relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage data. MySQL and MariaDB are interchangeable in LEMP stacks, as MariaDB is a fork of MySQL and aims to maintain compatibility.

**PHP**: A server-side scripting language used for web development. PHP is embedded in HTML code and processed by the web server, generating dynamic content. PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is a common implementation used with Nginx to handle PHP requests efficiently.
